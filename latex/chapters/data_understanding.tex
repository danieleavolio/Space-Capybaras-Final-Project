\label{sec:data_description}

The dataset we are using, House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques, is a dataset containing 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The dataset is composed of 1460 rows, each one representing a house, and 81 columns, 80 of which are features and 1 is the target variable, the SalePrice.

An important thing to specify is that the dataset is given with an additional "data\_description.txt" file that describes the features in detail. This file is used to understand the features and their values. From here, some
variables have a specific value to point the fact the the house doesn't have that feature. For example, the feature "Alley" has the value "NA" to point the fact that the house doesn't have an alley. This is important to know.
The next list contains all the features that have the value 'NA' indicating the non-existence of the feature.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Alley
    \item BsmtQual
    \item BsmtCond
    \item BsmtExposure
    \item BsmtFinType1
    \item BsmtFinType2
    \item FireplaceQu
    \item GarageType
    \item GarageFinish
    \item GarageQual
    \item GarageCond
    \item PoolQC
    \item Fence
    \item MiscFeature
\end{enumerate}

In this project, as a team we decided to consider those variables \textbf{not null}, and considering the value 'NA' always as the non-existence of the feature. This is important to know because it will be used in the data cleaning phase.

Note that this is not related to the other variables, since the variables not mentioned in the above list have the value 'NA' to indicate \textbf{null value}. For example, if in some rows the feature "MasVnrType" has the value "NA", it means that the value is null and not that the house doesn't have a masonry veneer type.

\section{Data exploration}
\label{sec:data_exploration}

The dataset contains 81 features, and 1460 rows. The attributes gives information about the house, and the target variable is the SalePrice. The goal of this project is to predict the SalePrice of a house given the features. The features are a mix of categorical and numerical variables.

\subsection{Preliminary operation on data preparation}
\label{sec:preliminary_operation_on_data_preparation}

In order to achieve \textbf{better results looking at data and graphs}, we decided to
do some data transformation and cleaning before the data processing part. This choice brings 
an easier and more intuitive data visualization and analysis for us, in order to get a better
insight of the data. 

The action carried out in this part are the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Trasnforming \textbf{NA} values into \textbf{no\_value} for the categorical features written in the precedent section.
    \item Setting GarageYrBlt, MasVnrArea, LotFrontage null values to \textbf{0}
    \item Changing all the columns with attribute \textbf{object} to \textbf{category} type
    \item Changed MasVnrArea and LotFrontage to \textbf{int64} type
    \item Dropped one row with Electrical null value
    \item Others changes during data visualization part (Will be reported in the data processing section)   
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Plotting}

\subsubsection*{Target variable}
As it can be seen in the graph, the target variable is strongly unbalanced, and in particular the label "HIGH" has very few data compared to the other two.\\
This will be taken into account during the modeling phase, considering also some oversampling techniques.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{imgs/SalePrice.png}
    \caption{}
    \label{SalePrice distribution}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Features}
After dropping some attributes for better visualization, we proceeded to analyze the distribution of the numerical attributes. This analysis provided us with valuable insights, which aided us in making decisions regarding the removal or transformation of certain numerical attributes into categorical ones. \\
By examining the distribution of numerical attributes, we gained a deeper understanding of their characteristics. These insights allowed us to determine which attributes could be removed without significant loss of information and which attributes could be better represented as categorical variables. \\

During the analysis of the numerical attributes, we discovered that about eleven of these attributes exhibited a right-skewed distribution; some just even had one value (LowQualityFinSF). Upon identifying this right-skewed behavior, we evaluated the relevance of these attributes to our analysis objectives. 
% These attributes are: 
% \begin{itemize}
% \item lotArea 
% \item MasVnrArea
% \item BsmtFinSF2
% \item LowQualFinSF
% \item ScreenPorch
% \item MiscVal
% \item PoolArea
% \item EnclosedPorch
% \item BsmtHalfBath
% \item 3SsnPorch
% \item KitchenAbvGr
% \end{itemize}
% TO ADD: IMAGES ON WORD

Among the numerical attributes, we observed that certain attributes exhibited interesting distributions. 
In particular, we noticed that the data were distributed almost evenly across the entire range, this attributes will help us design a good model.
\newpage
\subsubsection*{Example of useless feature}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{imgs/roofMatl.png}
    \caption{Roof Material}
    \label{fig:roofmaterial}
\end{figure}

Since this feature had only the 1 value for the 99\% of the data, we decided to drop it.

\subsubsection*{Example of nice feature}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{imgs/BsmtFinType1.png}
    \caption{BsmtFinType1}
    \label{fig:bsmtfintype1}
\end{figure}

The feature is well distributed. Yet, we didn't check if it has a good correlation with the target variable. This will be evaluated later on during the project in the model evaluation phase.
\newpage
\subsubsection*{Example of numerical feature correlated with the target variable}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{imgs/BarPlotYearBuilt.png}
    \caption{YearBuilt Bar Plot}
    \label{fig:yearbuilt}
\end{figure}

Form this graph we can see that the year built is a good feature to predict the target variable. In fact, the houses built in between the last year of 1900s and initial 2000s are mostly of high quality. This is a good feature to predict the target variable.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item 1stFlrSF
% \item BsmtUnfSF
% \item GarageArea
% \item MsSubClass
% \item TotsRmsAbvGrd
% \item OverallQual
% \item YearRemodAdd
% \item YearBuilt
% \end{itemize}
% 
% TO FINISH FROM MEREM DOC, WILL DO IT LATER TO SYNTETIZE IT IF WE NEED TO.
\newpage

\subsubsection*{Correlation Matrix}
The correlation matrix is a useful tool to understand the relationship between the variables. In particular, it is possible to see the correlation between the variables.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{imgs/CorrMatrixUnpruned.png}
    \caption{Correlation Matrix}
    \label{fig:corr}
\end{figure}

In this correlation matrix we can see that some features have a direct correlation with other variables. We decided to remove some of these features. In particular:
\begin{itemize}
    \item TotalBsmtSF 0.82 correlation with 1stFlrSF
    \item TotRmsAbvGrd 0.83 correlation with GrLivArea
    \item GarageCars 0.88 correlation with GarageArea
\end{itemize}
