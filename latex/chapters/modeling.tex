\chapter{Modeling and model evaluation}
\label{sec:data_preparation}

\section{Preliminary operations}
First steps in this part of the modeling was to split our dataset in a train set, used to train every model, and a test set, to compute the evaluation metrics of them.\\
Then, to avoid bias due to the unbalanced target classes, we did an oversampling over the sets using the SMOTE technique.
Finally, we have built many models, with an iterative approach over each one to find a proper parameters setting that could achieve good results.
FOREACH OF THESE, WE MUST HAVE MODEL METRICS (ACCURACY/PRECISION/RECALL/F1) + CLASSIFICATION MATRIX + ROC CURVE if we have some other stuff (features selection, Hyper param tuning, other info (like what i'll write for SVC)) they are gonna be there too
