\subsection{Background}
Our project is based using the dataset of the Kaggle competition \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques}{House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques}. 

The goal of the competition is to predict the final price of each home based on 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
The dataset is composed by 1460 rows and 81 columns, where the last column is the target variable, the Sale Price.

A small list of the variables is the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LotArea}: Lot size in square feet
    \item \textbf{OverallQual}: Overall material and finish quality
    \item \textbf{OverallCond}: Overall condition rating
    \item \textbf{YearBuilt}: Original construction date
    \item \textbf{YearRemodAdd}: Remodel date
    \item \textbf{RoofStyle}: Type of roof
    \item \textbf{Exterior1st}: Exterior covering on house
    \item \textbf{Exterior2nd}: Exterior covering on house (if more than one material)
    \item \textbf{MasVnrType}: Masonry veneer type
    \item \textbf{MasVnrArea}: Masonry veneer area in square feet
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Business objectives}
\label{subsec:business_objectives}

In this part we are going to analyze the business objective of the project.
Our goal is different from the one of the competition, in fact we are requested to \textbf{convert the Sale Price variable into 3 ranges}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{LOW}: From 0 to 150000 
    \item \textbf{MEDIUM}: From 150000 to 300000 
    \item \textbf{HIGH}: From 300000 and beyond 
\end{enumerate}
